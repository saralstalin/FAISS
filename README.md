# FAISS
Using Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS) and Open AI Text Embeddings to build a powerful product search engine in a few lines of code. 

It is built on colab and you would require an OpenAI API key to execute this. Open AI Text embeddings model is used to convert the product names to text embeddings and then it is stored in-memory FAISS vector store. You can choose to save this to a local file and read from that as well to avoid further Open AI API calls.

The product data used for this example is available as Products.csv.
